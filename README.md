# Fraud Detection System

This is a fraud detection system that uses machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. The system analyzes patterns in transaction data and flags any suspicious activity. 

## Getting Started

To get started with the fraud detection system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/fraud_detection_system.git`
2. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the `app.py` script to load the data, train the model, and deploy it into production: `python app.py`

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the transaction data and customer information used to train and evaluate the fraud detection model.
- `src/`: Contains Python modules for data loading, data preparation, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.
- `app.py`: The main Python script that loads the data, trains the model, and deploys it into production.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries for running the project.
